### The Cases

<p>Around the end of the first "CSS to The Rescue" lecture (given by Sanne 't Hooft and Nils Blinder), we were informed about the final assignment, containing 4 choices  </p>

<ul>
<li>Control Panel</li>
<li>Firework Show</li>
<li>Paper-airplane</li>
<li>Rubix Cube/li>
</ul>

<p>I picked fireworks for my project, but I wanted to spice it up. Just before the assessment, Sanne t'Hooft showed me some of his work that totally blew me away. It hardly had any JS, and I was like, "Wow!". My favorite one was <a href="https://sinds1971.nl/viswinkel/">Freddy's Fabulous Fish Tanks</a></p>. It's like a mix of a control panel and fireworks, even though the fish obviously don't explode. But when you mix up all the species, they create this incredible display.
